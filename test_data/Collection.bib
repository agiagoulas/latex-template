We aim at characterizing different microservice architectural style patterns and the principles that guide their definition. We conducted a systematic mapping study in order to identify reported usage of microservices and based on these use cases extract common patterns and principles. We present two key contributions. Firstly, we identified several agreed microservice architecture patterns that seem widely adopted and reported in the case studies identified. Secondly, we presented these as a catalogue in a common template format including a summary of the advantages, disadvantages, and lessons learned for each pattern from the case studies. We can conclude that different architecture patterns emerge for different migration, orchestration, storage and deployment settings for a set of agreed principles.},

abstract = {The k-means algorithm of the partitioning clustering method is used to analyze cloud migration strategies in this study. The extent of assistance required to be provided to organizations while working on migration strategies was investigated for each cloud service model and concrete clusters were formed. This investigation is intended to aid cloud consumers in selecting their required cloud migration strategy. It is not easy for businessmen to select the most appropriate cloud migration strategy, and therefore, we proposed a suitable model to solve this problem. This model comprises a web of migration strategies, which provides an unambiguous visualization of the selected migration strategy. The cloud migration strategy targets the technical aspects linked with cloud facilities and measures the critical realization factors for cloud acceptance. Based on similar features, a correlation among the migration strategies is suggested, and three main clusters are formed accordingly. This helps to link the cloud migration strategies across the cloud service models (software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service). This correlation was justified using the digital logic approach. This study is useful for the academia and industry as the proposed migration strategy selection process aids cloud consumers in efficiently selecting a cloud migration strategy for their legacy applications.},

abstract = {Today, most of the organizations trust on their age old legacy applications, to support their business-critical systems. However, there are several critical concerns, as maintainability and scalability issues, associated with the legacy system. In this background, cloud services offer a more agile and cost effective platform, to support business applications and IT infrastructure. As the adoption of cloud services has been increasing recently and so has been the academic research in cloud migration. However, there is a genuine need of secondary study to further strengthen this research. The primary objective of this paper is to scientifically and systematically identify, categorize and compare the existing research work in the area of legacy to cloud migration. The paper has also endeavored to consolidate the research on Security issues, which is prime factor hindering the adoption of cloud through classifying the studies on secure cloud migration. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) of thirty selected papers, published from 2009 to 2014 was conducted to properly understand the nuances of the security framework. To categorize the selected studies, authors have proposed a conceptual model for cloud migration which has resulted in a resource base of existing solutions for cloud migration. This study concludes that cloud migration research is in seminal stage but simultaneously it is also evolving and maturing, with increasing participation from academics and industry alike. The paper also identifies the need for a secure migration model, which can fortify organization's trust into cloud migration and facilitate necessary tool support to automate the migration process.},

abstract = {Summary Microservices architectures are becoming the defacto standard for building continuously deployed systems. At the same time, there is a substantial growth in the demand for migrating on-premise legacy applications to the cloud. In this context, organizations tend to migrate their traditional architectures into cloud-native architectures using microservices. This article reports a set of migration and rearchitecting design patterns that we have empirically identified and collected from industrial-scale software migration projects. These migration patterns can help information technology organizations plan their migration projects toward microservices more efficiently and effectively. In addition, the proposed patterns facilitate the definition of migration plans by pattern composition. Qualitative empirical research is used to evaluate the validity of the proposed patterns. Our findings suggest that the proposed patterns are evident in other architectural refactoring and migration projects and strong candidates for effective patterns in system migrations.},

abstract = {Cloud computing provides means for reducing over-and under-provisioning through enabling a highly flexible resource allocation. Running an existing software system on a cloud computing basis can involve extensive reengineering activities during the migration. To reduce the correspondent effort, it is often possible to deploy an existing system widely unmodified in IaaS VM instances. However, this simplistic migration approach does not solve the challenge of over-and under-provisioning or scalability issues per se, as our experiments using Eucalyptus and the popular open source system Apache OFBiz show. Moreover, current migration approaches suffer from several further shortcomings. For example, they are often limited to specific cloud environments or do not provide automated support for the alignment with a cloud environment. We present our model-based approach CloudMIG which addresses these shortcomings. It aims at supporting SaaS providers to semi-automatically migrate existing enterprise software systems to scalable and resource-efficient PaaS and IaaS-based applications. To facilitate reasoning about the suitability of certain cloud environments for a given system and the degree of alignment during the reengineering process, we introduce the Cloud Suitability and Alignment (CSA) hierarchy. For example, Apache OFBiz used in our experiments is initially categorized "cloud compatible" but not "cloud optimized" as it does not exploit the cloud's advantages.},

abstract = {Shale represents strongly intrinsic vertical transverse isotropy (VTI) due to its unique microstructure. One of the major reasons causes the seismic anisotropy of shale is the platy shape and preferred orientation of clay particles and kerogen. Effectively modelling the seismic anisotropy is important in the seismic processing and inversion, as well as the hydraulic fracture monitoring. In order to construct a realistic rock physics model for clay-rich shales, it is important to simulate the intrinsic VTI anisotropy caused by the present of various clay minerals. In this paper, we propose a practical framework for the estimation of effective elastic stiffness of clay-rich shales. The intrinsic VTI anisotropy is modelled by the construction of background basic units using variously aliened clay minerals as well as kerogen, which is more general than the existing models. Other minerals and pores are included in the anisotropic background by means of the anisotropic differential effective medium method. We apply the rock physics model to predict the elastic properties of a shale formation in Western Sichuan basin, and the results are demonstrated with the corresponding logs. The predicted vertical P- and S-wave velocities show good agreement with the real logs; the estimated anisotropy parameters are used to calibrate the AVA (amplitude versus angle) response and to correct the P-wave velocity log in the horizontal well.},

Little, if any, research has aimed on developing an integrated process model which captures core domain concepts and ties them together to provide an overarching view of migrating legacy systems to cloud platforms that is customisable for a given context. We adopt design science research guidelines in which we use a metamodeling approach to develop a generic process model and then evaluate and refine the model through three case studies and domain expert reviews. This research benefits academics and practitioners alike by underpinning a substrate for constructing, standardising, maintaining, and sharing bespoke cloud migration models that can be applied to given cloud adoption scenarios.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of processing and storage technologies and the success of the Internet, computing resources have become cheaper, more powerful and more available than ever before. This technological trend has enabled the realization of a new computing model called cloud computing, in which resources are provided as general utilities that can be leased and released by users through the Internet in an on-demand fashion. The organizations are gaining more experience in the cloud and they start to shift more core business functions onto cloud platforms. Because of this fact, we are seeing that cloud adoption is significantly more complex than we imagined initially, particularly in terms of data management, system integration and the management of multiple cloud providers. Cloud computing is of growing interest to companies around the globe, but many are finding greater costs and greater obstacles to the adoption of cloud computing than they anticipated. In this case, is cloud computing still able to deliver all the promises? In this paper we will analyze from a company's point of view the factors that need to be considered by an enterprise when making the decision of using cloud computing. Some of the companies are moving towards cloud computing just because it is the latest trend in information technology. On the other hand, other companies cannot even take into consideration the idea of having their sensitive data outside their premises. Both of these cases represent companies that are just not very well informed. We are not sustaining that cloud computing is a perfect solution for everybody, but adopting it or not should be result of a very well informed analysis. We will analyze the positive and negative aspects of each of the following factors: integration with existing IT infrastructure and existing software, costs, return on investment, performances, security. Also, we will correlate all these factors with the company size and business area in order to identify if or what type of cloud computing solution is suitable for their needs.},

Our results show that the system infrastructure in the case study would have cost 37{\%} less over 5 years on EC2, and using cloud computing could have potentially eliminated 21{\%} of the support calls for this system. These findings seem significant enough to call for a migration of the system to the cloud but our stakeholder impact analysis revealed that there are significant risks associated with this. Whilst the benefits of using the cloud are attractive, we argue that it is important that enterprise decision-makers consider the overall organizational implications of the changes brought about with cloud computing to avoid implementing local optimizations at the cost of organization-wide performance.},

abstract = {Abstract—Background—By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective—This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method—We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results—The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion—This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems},
